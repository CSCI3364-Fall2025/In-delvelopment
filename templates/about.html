        <p>
            &emsp; The Peer Assessment System was developed incrementally throughout the course <b>CSCI3356 Software Engineering </b>
            during Boston College's spring semester in 2025. Our team, Ctrl-Alt-Elite, consisted of 5 members:
            Julian Castro, Abraham Gonzalez Diaz, Wesley Lawson, Rafeed Mahmood, and Junhao Yan.

        <p>
            &emsp; Developing our peer-review application, we fully met every critical requirement laid out by the course. 
            User authentication employs Google OAuth and restricts logins to @bc.edu addresses; once signed in, individuals 
            are designated as either professors or students. Professors can create courses, specifying year, semester, and any 
            number of groups or teams, and then invite students via time-limited email links. Within each course, instructors 
            may define multiple peer assessments per semester, each with configurable publication and closing dates and a custom mix 
            of Likert-scale and open-ended questions. A flag controls whether students evaluate themselves as well as teammates. 
            On the scheduled publication date, the system opens the assessment form and sends notification emails. When closing, it 
            locks submissions and issues a closing alert. Students are given these notifications via email, which adjust in real time 
            depending on the assignment. After the deadline, professors review and moderate responses, publish the results, and trigger 
            notification emails so that students can view their quantitative averages alongside anonymized, alphabetically sorted qualitative feedback. 
            Professors also have the flexibility to update assignments after an initial publication, which allows for them to update reviews 
            depending on changing class needs. 
            <br>
            &emsp; On the non-functional side, we adhered strictly to the prescribed technology stack, 
            Django for the backend and plain HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, without introducing any additional frameworks. 
            We also used Google OAuth implementation as requested, adhering to the requirement of needing a BC email. This can be scaled 
            to other schools through the same methodology.
